		<h2>Outer space, commonly shortened to space, is the expanse that exists beyond Earth and its atmosphere and between celestial bodies. Space is often described as a vacuum; devoid of matter or put simply empty. That is not entirely true though, as lots of things have clearly been seen in outer space, from galaxies and star systems, which consist of meteors, comets, and other planets, to the less visible systems of gas, dust, radiation, gravity, and a whole host of other things. Nevertheless, what is true is that space is mostly empty--so much of it is in fact nothing but cosmic voids.</h2>

Inhabitants of this cold, dark environment include the elusive giant squid, various octopi, bioluminescent jellyfish, anglerfish and hatchetfish.

The deepest ocean trenches are considered the least explored and most extreme marine ecosystems. They are characterized by complete lack of sunlight, low temperatures, nutrient scarcity, and extremely high hydrostatic pressures. Most organisms found here are scavengers and detritivores. Over 400 species are currently known from hadal ecosystems, many of which possess physiological adaptations to the extreme environmental conditions. There are high levels of endemism, and noteworthy examples of gigantism in amphipods, mysids, and isopods and dwarfism in nematodes, copepods, and kinorhynchs. The deepest point in the ocean is located in the Mariana Trench off the coast of Japan at 10,984 meters.</h3>

		<h2>Aside from being outermost layer of Earth, the crust is also the thinnest and the most rudimentary layer that makes up the earth. The earth’s crust, or surface to be specific, can be divided into 15 principal tectonic plates. These tectonic plates are also split into two types: the oceanic crust that forms Earth's oceans, and the continental crust that makes up the land on Earth. The oceanic crust is made mostly of basalt- a dark, dense rock made mostly of metals. The continental crust is made mostly of granite- a lighter, less dense rock, composed primarily of silicon and oxygen. The continental crust is much thicker and less dense, while the oceanic crust is much thinner and very dense. These plates are moved around by the convection currents within the mantle, albeit very, very slowly. When the oceanic and continental crusts are pushed together, the oceanic crust is forced below, because of its high density. These movements of the tectonic plates are the cause of geological activity, such as mountains, volcanoes, and earthquakes. The crust--and the extreme upper mantle, which moves with the crust--is often referred to as the lithosphere. </h2><br>

		<h2>The mantle is the thickest layer of Earth, making up about 82% of its volume. The mantle lies between the earth's crust and its dense, super-heated core. The mantle is composed primarily of heavy metals, such as iron, nickel, magnesium, and others. However, mantle material behaves like a viscous fluid over long geological timescales and plays a part in the dynamic nature of Earth's ridged outer layer. It is divided into several layers: the upper mantle, the transition zone, the lower mantle, and D” (D double-prime), the strange region where the mantle meets the outer core. It can also be divided into the asthenosphere and lithosphere.</h2><br>
